# Web-Scraping-Groq-based-Chatbot

This project implements a Streamlit application that allows users to interact with any website through a Q&A chatbot interface. The code performs real-time web scraping using Selenium and BeautifulSoup, generates text embeddings with SentenceTransformer, and stores them in a Chroma vector database for efficient retrieval. Integrated with the Groq LLaMA model, the chatbot provides context-aware answers based on the scraped content, enabling dynamic exploration and querying of web pages.
